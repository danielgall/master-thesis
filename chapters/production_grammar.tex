\chapter{Grammar for Production Rules}

The complete grammar for production rules as defined in \cite{actr_reference}:

\begin{lstlisting}
production-definition ::= p-name {doc-string} condition* ==> action*
p-name ::= a symbol that serves as the name of the production for reference
doc-string ::= a string which can be used to document the production
condition ::= [ buffer-test | query | eval | binding | multiple-value-binding]
action ::= [buffer-modification | request | buffer-clearing | modification-request | buffer-overwrite | eval |
binding | multiple-value-binding | output | !stop!]
buffer-test ::= =buffer-name> isa chunk-type slot-test*
buffer-name ::= a symbol which is the name of a buffer
chunk-type ::= a symbol which is the name of a chunk-type in the model
slot-test ::= {slot-modifier} slot-name slot-value
slot-modifier ::= [= | - | < | > | <= | >=]
slot-name ::= a symbol which names a possible slot in the specified chunk-type
slot-value ::= a variable or any Lisp value
query ::= ?buffer-name> query-test*
query-test ::= {-} queried-item query-value
queried-item ::= a symbol which names a valid query for the specified buffer
query-value ::= a bound-variable or any Lisp value
buffer-modification ::= =buffer-name> slot-value-pair*
slot-value-pair ::= slot-name bound-slot-value
bound-slot-value ::= a bound variable or any Lisp value
request ::= +buffer-name> [direct-value | isa chunk-type request-spec*]
request-spec ::= {slot-modifier} [slot-name | request-parameter] slot-value
request-parameter ::= a Lisp keyword naming a request parameter provided by the buffer specified
direct-value ::= a variable or Lisp symbol
buffer-clearing ::= -buffer-name>
modification-request ::= +buffer-name> slot-value-pair*
buffer-overwrite ::= =buffer-name> direct-value
variable ::= a symbol which starts with the character =
eval ::= [!eval! | !safe-eval!] form
binding ::= [!bind! | !safe-bind!] variable form
+
multiple-value-binding ::= !mv-bind! (variable ) form
output ::= !output! [ output-value | ( format-string format-args*) | (output-value*)]
output-value ::= any Lisp value or a bound-variable
format-string ::= a Lisp string which may contain format specific parameter processing character
format-args ::= any Lisp values, including bound-variables, which will be processed by the preceding
format-string
bound-variable
 ::= a variable which is used in the buffer-test conditions of the production (including a
variable which names the buffer that is tested in a buffer-test or dynamic-buffer-test) or is bound with
an explicit binding in the production
form ::= a valid Lisp form
